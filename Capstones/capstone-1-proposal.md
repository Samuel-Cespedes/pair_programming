# **Capstone 1 Proposals**

## Option 1:

[Crime Incidence in Puerto Rico 2012-2016](https://www.kaggle.com/fireballbyedimyrnmom/puerto-rico-dataset?select=Incidencia_Crime_Map.csv)

- The intention is to determine an increase in the rate of crimes acrosse a given period of time grouped by district, crime code, and hour.  One hypothesis could be that crimes of a certain category increased more than the rest.


## Option 2:

[English Premier League 2020-2021](https://www.kaggle.com/rajatrc1705/english-premier-league202021)

- The English Premier Legue is arguably the most popular football league in the world.  The goal here would be to prove that each country of origin (players) produces more of a specific position.

## Option 3:

[MLB Teams Ranks & Game Results 2012-2021](https://www.kaggle.com/finkleiseinhorn/mlbranksgames)

- Here I would set out to prove that the New York Yankess, even though they havenâ€™t won a world series since 2009, are still the best performing team on the league.
